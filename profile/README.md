## ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the home of Module Federation
Webpack Module federation was created by Zackary Jackson and now officially part of webpack. While the core documentation 
is available on the webpack documentation [site](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/module-federation/) this GitHub organization 
provides additional resources for folks looking to learn more about Module Federation. 

### What is Module Federation?

Webpack Module Federation (MF) is a feature of webpack that allows for the dynamic loading of multiple versions of a module from multiple independent build systems. 

This allows for the creation of microfrontend-style applications, where multiple systems can share code and be dynamically updated without having to rebuild the entire application. 

It also enables distributed teams and applications with different release cycles to share code without needing to wait for all systems to agree to and deploy a single shared version of a module. 

Additionally, it allows for code-splitting based on routes and other criteria, which can improve performance.
